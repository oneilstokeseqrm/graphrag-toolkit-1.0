### Overview

You can use Amazon Neptune Analytics as a graph store.

### Creating a Neptune Analytics graph store

Use the `GraphStoreFactory.for_graph_store()` static factory method to create an instance of a Neptune Analytics graph store.

To create a Neptune Analytics graph store, supply a connection string that begins `neptune-graph://`, followed by the graph's identifier:

```python
from graphrag_toolkit.lexical_graph.storage import GraphStoreFactory

neptune_connection_info = 'neptune-graph://g-jbzzaqb209'

with GraphStoreFactory.for_graph_store(neptune_connection_info) as graph_store:
    ...
```
