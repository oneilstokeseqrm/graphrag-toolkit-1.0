    Handles the construction and management of graph structures.

    GraphBuilder serves as a base class for implementing components that facilitate the
    creation, indexing, and management of graphs within a specific application context. It
    provides a structure for defining essential methods that subclasses must override to
    handle graph building and indexing functionalities.

    Attributes:
        index_key (str): Represents the unique key or identifier used to distinguish
            the indexing strategy of the graph structure.

        Converts a given dictionary into a specific parameters structure expected by
        the application or system.

        The function processes the input dictionary and wraps it inside another
        dictionary under the key `'params'`. It ensures consistency in the data
        format for further use or processing.

        Args:
            p (Dict): A dictionary containing the parameters to be converted.
