    NodeBuilder is an abstract base class responsible for constructing and managing
    nodes. It provides a blueprint for creating nodes with specific attributes,
    filters, and metadata formatting.

    Detailed description of the class, its purpose, and usage. The class includes
    methods for cleaning and formatting data, as well as abstract methods that
    must be implemented by subclasses to define the class name, metadata keys,
    and the node-building logic.

    Attributes:
        id_generator (IdGenerator): Generates unique identifiers for nodes.
        build_filters (BuildFilters): Filters applied when building nodes.
        source_metadata_formatter (SourceMetadataFormatter): Formats source
            metadata for nodes.
