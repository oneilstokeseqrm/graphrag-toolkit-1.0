    Handles batched operations with a graph store client.

    GraphBatchClient is designed for handling operations in batches to optimize performance
    when interacting with a GraphStore. It enables batching of writes and efficient processing
    of graph queries, with support for retrying queries.

    Attributes:
        graph_client (GraphStore): The underlying graph store client used for executing
            queries and node operations.
        batch_writes_enabled (bool): Flag indicating whether batch writes are enabled.
        batch_write_size (int): The maximum number of entries in a batch.
        batches (dict): A mapping of queries to their associated batched parameters.
        all_nodes (list): A collection of all nodes processed for yielding.
