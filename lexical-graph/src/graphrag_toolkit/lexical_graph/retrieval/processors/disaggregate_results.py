    Processes search results to disaggregate topics.

    The DisaggregateResults class extends the ProcessorBase class, and its primary
    purpose is to process a collection of search results by disaggregating topics
    within each search result. Each topic is evaluated individually with its
    corresponding score, allowing more granular analysis or filtering.

    Attributes:
        args (ProcessorArgs): Configuration and runtime arguments passed
            to the processor.

            filtering criteria and logic.

        Initializes the Processor class with provided arguments and filter configuration.

        This method sets up the processor by utilizing the given configuration and

        This method analyzes each search result, iterating through the associated topics, and isolates them into
        individual search results with updated scores based on the highest statement score within the topic. The
        updated collection of search results is then returned.
