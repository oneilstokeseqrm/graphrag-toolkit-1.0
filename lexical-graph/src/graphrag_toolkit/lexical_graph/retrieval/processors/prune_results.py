    Represents a processor that prunes search results based on a score threshold.

    This class inherits from ProcessorBase and processes search results by applying a pruning function.
    The pruning removes results that do not meet a predefined score threshold. It is designed for use
    cases where it is necessary to filter out low-scoring results from a search result collection.

    Attributes:
        args (ProcessorArgs): Arguments containing configuration and settings for the pruning process,
            including the results pruning threshold.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Configuration for filtering, providing additional parameters
            or constraints that may influence the pruning logic.

            search_results: The collection of search results to be processed. Each result may either
                be retained or pruned based on its score relative to the pruning threshold.
            query: The query bundle associated with the search results, providing context for processing.
