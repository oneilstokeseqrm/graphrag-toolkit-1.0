    Handles the processing of clearing scores from search results.

    This class is designed to process a collection of search results and remove the
    scores associated with them. It uses the base ProcessorBase functionality to
    apply the clearing operation to each search result in the given collection.
    This can be useful in scenarios where the scores are either irrelevant or need
    to be redacted for further processing.

    Attributes:
        args (ProcessorArgs): Arguments required for initializing the processor,
            providing configuration and operational parameters.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Configuration settings for filtering, passed
            during instantiation.
