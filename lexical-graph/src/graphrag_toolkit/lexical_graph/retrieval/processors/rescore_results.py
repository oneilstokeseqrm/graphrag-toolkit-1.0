    Represents a processor for rescoring search results by recalculating scores based on
    topic-level analysis. This class adjusts the overall score of each search result
    by averaging the highest statement scores within its associated topics.

    This class is designed to refine search result rankings by promoting results with
    higher relevance as indicated by topic-level scoring. It leverages an internal
    rescoring logic to compute adjusted scores efficiently.

    Attributes:
        args (ProcessorArgs): Configuration arguments for the processor, including runtime-specific details.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Configuration for filtering criteria applied during result processing.

            processing that updates the final score of a search result by calculating the mean
