    Handles result deduplication by merging duplicate result entries and their nested

    The DedupResults class is a processor that removes duplicate results based on the
    source ID. It combines overlapping topics, chunks, and statements from matching
    results and adjusts their scores accordingly. This class aims to provide a
    consolidated view of search results by aggregating redundant data.

    Attributes:
        args (ProcessorArgs): Configuration arguments needed for processing.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Configuration for managing filtering behavior.

                a ProcessorArgs instance, which contains necessary
                information for processing tasks.

                within a FilterConfig instance, which specifies the
                configuration related to filters.
