    The StatementsToStrings class is a specialized processor that transforms
    statements into string representations. It provides functionality for

    string equivalents, adhering to specific filtration configurations. This
    can be useful for applications requiring formatted outputs of statements
    or further downstream processing where raw statements should be converted to strings.

            the processing operation.
