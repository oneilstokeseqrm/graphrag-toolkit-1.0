    Base class for semantic-guided retrievers.

    This class serves as a blueprint for implementing retrievers that leverage
    a combination of vector and graph stores for semantic-guided retrieval. It
    facilitates structured retrieval processes and allows for filtering configurations.
    The class is designed to be extended by implementing the `_retrieve` method.

    Attributes:
        graph_store (GraphStore): The graph store used for managing and accessing
            graph-based data relevant to the retrieval process.
        vector_store (VectorStore): The vector store used for managing and querying
            vectorized data for semantic search.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Configuration settings used for applying filters
            during the retrieval process. A default configuration is applied if not provided.
        debug_results (bool): Indicates whether to enable debugging for retrieved
            results. Debug mode is enabled when `debug_results` is explicitly specified
            in the keyword arguments.

            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments allowing further customization.

        """
        Retrieves a list of nodes with associated scores based on the provided query bundle.

        This is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It defines the
        core logic for retrieving relevant nodes that match the criteria specified in the
        query bundle. The specific implementation details of the retrieval should take into
        account how the nodes are stored and how relevance is determined.

        Args:
            query_bundle: An instance of QueryBundle, which encapsulates the parameters
                and data needed to perform the retrieval operation. This may include
                query text, filters, or any other necessary metadata.

        Returns:
            List[NodeWithScore]: A list of NodeWithScore objects, where each object
                represents a node and its associated relevance score to the given query.
                The nodes should be ordered based on their relevance.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: This method must be implemented by any subclass. A call
                to the method in the base class will raise this exception.
