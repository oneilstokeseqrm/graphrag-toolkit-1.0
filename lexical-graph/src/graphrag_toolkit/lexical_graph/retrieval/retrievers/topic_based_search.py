    """
    A retriever class implementing topic-based search within a knowledge graph.

    The `TopicBasedSearch` class specializes in retrieving information from a
    graph database using a topic-based approach. It extends the
    `TraversalBasedBaseRetriever` to provide functionality specific to exploring
    the graph based on topic relationships. The retriever employs both a graph
    store for hierarchical relationships and a vector store for semantic queries.
    This is particularly useful in scenarios where topic-centric information
    organization and retrieval are required.

    Attributes:
        graph_store (GraphStore): An instance of the backing graph database used to
            execute cypher queries.
        vector_store (VectorStore): A vector store used for semantic representation
            and querying.
        processor_args (Optional[ProcessorArgs]): Optional arguments for
            configuring preprocessing workflows.
        processors (Optional[List[Type[ProcessorBase]]]): A list of processor
            classes for custom data preprocessing.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Configuration for how filtering should be
            applied to retrieve results.

        The query traverses relationships such as `__NEXT__`, `__SUPPORTS__`, and
