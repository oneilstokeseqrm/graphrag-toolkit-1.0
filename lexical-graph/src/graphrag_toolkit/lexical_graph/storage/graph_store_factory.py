    Factory class for registering and creating GraphStore objects.

    Provides methods to register custom factory implementations and retrieve
    instances of GraphStore based on input parameters. Handles dynamic
    factory method registration and graph store instance creation.

    Attributes:
        _graph_store_factories (dict): Internal storage of registered
            factory methods, mapping factory names to their respective
            instances.

        Registers a factory type instance or class to the internal factory registry.

        This method allows registration of classes inheriting from GraphStoreFactoryMethod
        or their instances. The input factory_type is checked for its validity as a subclass
        or instance of GraphStoreFactoryMethod. If this condition is met, the factory
        type is added to the registry with its class name as the key.

            factory_type (GraphStoreFactoryMethod | type): The factory type, which can either
                be a subclass of GraphStoreFactoryMethod or an instance of that subclass.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If factory_type is neither a subclass of GraphStoreFactoryMethod
                nor an instance of that class. The error message will indicate the exact
                nature of the issue.

        Creates and returns a GraphStore instance based on the provided connection

        This method is responsible for initializing the GraphStore by either using
        the given `graph_info` directly (if it is an instance of `GraphStore`) or
        by utilizing the registered factory methods to create an appropriate
        GraphStore instance. If factory creation is not successful, it raises a

                existing instance of `GraphStore`. If it's an instance of `GraphStore`,
                it will be returned directly. Otherwise, it is used to create the
