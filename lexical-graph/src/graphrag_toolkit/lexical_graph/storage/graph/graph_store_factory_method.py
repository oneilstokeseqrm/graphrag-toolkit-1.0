    GraphStoreFactoryMethod provides an abstraction for creating GraphStore objects.

    This class defines a factory method pattern that serves as the template for creating
    instances of `GraphStore`. It provides a contract that must be implemented by
    subclasses, specifying how `GraphStore` objects are instantiated based on
    graph configuration details.

    Methods:
        try_create(graph_info, **kwargs): Abstract method to attempt the creation
            of a `GraphStore` instance based on provided graph configuration
            and optional parameters.

        Abstract base class for creating a graph store from provided graph information.

        This class represents the structure that any concrete implementation must adhere
        to, ensuring that essential methods related to graph creation are defined.

        Attributes:
            graph_info (str): Information or details about the graph structure, which
                will be used for constructing the graph store.
            **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments that might be required to configure
                the creation process.
