Each tool is capable of answering domain-specific questions based on the data in its tenant graph. This catalog will be advertised to clients via an MCP server. Clients (typically agents and LLMs) can then browse the catalog and choose appropriate tools for addressing their information goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool in the catalog is accompanied by an auto-generated description that helps a client understand the domain, scope, potential uses and kinds of questions covered by the tool. The catalog also includes a 'search' tool, which, given the name of an entity or concept, recommends one or more domain tools with knowledge of the search term."
